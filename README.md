# WK5_Assignment: Net Salary Calculator and Sorting Names

## Overview
Welcome to the WK5_Assignment! This assignment comprises of two programming tasks: implementing a net salary calculator and sorting names. This README provides comprehensive instructions, assessment goals, and guidelines for completing the assignment.

## Getting Started
To begin, ensure you have a C compiler installed on your system. If not, you can download and install GCC, the GNU Compiler Collection, which is a free and open-source compiler.

## Cloning the Repository
1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
3. Use the following command to clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Magotgarang/wk5_assignment.git

## Compilation
1. Once the repository is cloned, navigate to the `WK5_Assignment` directory.
2. Use the following commands to compile the programs:
gcc net_salary_calculator.c -o net_salary_calculator
gcc sorting_names.c -o sorting_names


## Running the Programs
### Net Salary Calculator
1. To run the net salary calculator program, use the following command:
./net_salary_calculator
2. Follow the prompts to input the gross salary and view the calculated net salary.

### Sorting Names
1. To run the sorting names program, use the following command:
./sorting_names
2. Follow the prompts to enter 'asc' for ascending order or 'desc' for descending order, and view the sorted names accordingly.

## Sample Input/Output
### Net Salary Calculator
- Sample Input:
Enter gross salary: 1000

- Sample Output:
Net salary: $791.70

### Sorting Names
- Sample Input:
Enter 'asc' for ascending order or 'desc' for descending order: asc

- Sample Output:
1.Sam
2.David
3.Andrew

##Assessment Goals
Understand the stack and the heap.
Understand pointers on variables, arrays, and strings.
Understand nested loops while using arrays and strings.
Leverage functions to write modular programs.
